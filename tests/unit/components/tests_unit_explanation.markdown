# Unit Test Explanation

## Mocking

No mocking was required as Todo.vue has no external dependencies (e.g., APIs or other components) that need isolation.

## Failing Test Example

No test actually failed but I had this error because I did not have my vitest.setup.js in the right directory.

Fix - I moved it into the main directory.
