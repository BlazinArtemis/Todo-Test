# E2E Test Explanation

## Handling Flakiness
- Used `waitForURL` to confirm navigation post-login.
- Leveraged Playwright's auto-waiting for element visibility.
- Selected elements by text for reliability.

## Reporting Test Failures
Failures are reported via Playwrightâ€™s HTML reporter and the link can be shared.

## Integration into CI
In CI (e.g., GitHub Actions):
1. Install dependencies and start the server.
2. Run `npx playwright test`.
3. Generate and archive reports for review.

yaml would look like this:

```yaml

  push:
    branches: [ main, master ]
  pull_request:
    branches: [ main, master ]
  # Allow manual trigger
